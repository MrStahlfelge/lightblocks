## Contribute

Contributions are welcome: bug fixes, enhancements, translations etc. Please be aware that
Falling Lightblocks is designed with certain design principles in mind, so if you plan to make some
more efforts, please open an issue to check if your ideas will fit the game.

Some principles the game and its evolvement is based on:
* Features must work on every targeted platform (HTML!) and device
* Features must work with every supported input device (touch, controller, keyboard)
* Changes must not affect scoring of existing game modes
* Falling Lightblocks means classic gameplay, though it is okay if some game modes are guideline

For everyone wanting to contribute: Sorry for all the German comments and commit messages that will
make it more difficult for you. I didn't plan to open the source from the beginning, and I tend to
write notes for myself in my native tongue.
