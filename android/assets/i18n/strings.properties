tutorialStep0=Welcome to Falling Lightblocks!\nYou can play this game with On Screen Buttons or \
  Gesture Control.\n\nTap to learn how to use the Gesture Control.
tutorialStep1=Probably you have seen some game with a similar idea before. Main concept is very easy...\n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialStep2=One block after another is falling down your gameboard. You can rotate it and move it sideways.\n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialStep3=Once the block has been dropped at the ground, it can't be moved any more.\n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialStep4=As soon as a line is full of blocks, they'll disappear and you'll earn score. Now that's really easy, isn't it?\n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialStep5=Now you want to know how to rotate and move these blocks? It's easy, too...\n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialStep6=_IMG_mission0-1_Just tap on the right hand side of the screen to rotate the block clockwise. Try it!
tutorialStep7=_IMG_mission0-2_Very good. Now tap on the left hand side of the screen to rotate the block counterclockwise!
tutorialStep8=Very good! You will be a champion!\nPerhaps you have noticed a virtual gamepad appearing every time you tapped on the screen. \
  Tap down and hold to get a closer look! Then lift your finger and tap to continue.
tutorialStep9=_IMG_mission0-3_You can move the block the following way: Tap the screen and hold, swipe to the arrow pointing to your desired direction and keep holding! \
  The block will move until you lift your finger. Try to move it to the right boundary!
tutorialStep10=Perfect! Now move it to the left boundary!
tutorialStep11=Perhaps you've noticed that there is also an arrow pointing downwards briefly visible. While it is visible, \
  you can swipe down to move the active block faster to the ground.\n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialStep12=Now you have learned about the basics of Falling Lightblocks' Gesture Control.\nYou can switch off the visibility of the virtual gamepad in the settings. \
  In case you don't like the gesture controls, there are more ways to control the game:\n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialStep13=You can connect a game controller, or there is a Gravity control available which is much more difficult.\n\
  Besides, you can also activate on screen buttons control in the settings.\n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialStep14=Now complete this tutorial by just clearing one line. Tap to begin - and good luck. :-)
tutorialMission01_1=Welcome to your first mission. Missions have different goals to achieve. \n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialMission01_2=Goals could be clearing a certain number of lines, or gain a certain score, for instance. \
  You will be informed about the goal at the beginning or in the pause screen. \n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialMission01_3=In this first mission, you just have to be relaxed. \n And clear five lines.\nThe more score you gain, the better.\n \
  The more lines you clear at once, the more score you earn! \n \
  Single line: 40\nTwo lines: 100\nThree lines: 300\nFour lines: 1200\n (_CONTINUE_)
tutorialMission01_4=You see, you have to clear as many lines at once as possible! \n Now, go on! Have fun!
goalTutorial=Complete the tutorial by following the instructions.
goalRelax=To complete this mission, you need to\nclear {0} lines.\nMaximum number of blocks to use: {2}
goalClean=To complete this mission, clean the initial garbage from the gameboard. You have a maximum number of {0} blocks to use.
goalSpecialMove=To complete this mission, you have to\nclean four lines at once {0} times\nmake {1} T-Spins\nachieve {3} Double Specials.\
  \nMaximum number of blocks to use: {2}
tutorialMission04_1=You might have realized that game speed is increasing - you are getting better!\n \
  Now it is time again to learn a bit.\n (_CONTINUE_)
tutorialMission04_2=As said before: The more lines you clear at once, the more points you get. There is no way to \
  clear more than four lines at once, and there is only one block with which you can do it: the I. \
  On average, you get an I every seventh block.\n (_CONTINUE_)
tutorialMission04_3=That is why clearing four lines is a "special" clear in this game and gets rewarded with such a high score. \
  You should try to accomplish a "four liner" as often as possible. This is your exercise lesson now. Make a four liner! But: You've got only 30 blocks!
tutorialMission06_1=_IMG_mission6_T-Spin time!\nAnother special move in this game is the so-called "T-Spin". As the name suggests, \
  it can only performed with the T block. I have prepared the gameboard for you to exercise T-Spins.\n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialMission06_2=You can perform a T-Spin on this gameboard by let the T falling down at the left boundary with its \
  nose to the left. (Nice as I am, I also prepared that for you.)\n\
  As soon as it hits the ground but hasn't been dropped yet, rotate it counterclockwise and the magic will happen.\n\
  Timing is everything. You can do it!
tutorialMission08_1=Another way to a achieve a higher score is to get score for Double Specials. How to do that? \
  Now that is easy: Clear four lines at once and then clear four lines at once a second time.\n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialMission08_2=Important is that that you make no ordinary line clear and don't perform a hold in the meantime. \
  You will be rewarded with a double special bonus: you'll get 50% more score for your clearance.\nTry it now!
goalGarbage=To complete this mission, you have to\nplace {0} blocks.\nBeware of the incoming garbage!
tutorialMission09_1=Lightblocks has a great multiplayer mode which you should try!\nWhen playing against an opponent, \
  you will receive the same blocks, and every time one of you clears at least two lines at once the other one will get garbage inserted in his \
  gameboard.\n(_CONTINUE_)
tutorialMission09_2=Playing with garbage requires completely different tactics. You must try to be ready for an I to \
  perform a Four Liner, but in addition you must always be ready to clear lines for not getting too high.\n\
  Now it's time to exercise! Place 75 blocks on the board to complete this mission.\n\
  You will see, playing against garbage is a challenge! Have fun!
tutorialMission11=It's time to use Gravity control!\nNow your device's built-in accelerometer will control the blocks. \
  It works best when you sit up straight. Hold your device steady in a comfortable position and let the calibration do \
  its work. Block rotation is done the same way as in gesture control, but moving the block left or right is done by \
  tilting the device gently in the desired direction.\n\
  It's not easy, but a challenge!\n\nClear 5 lines to complete this mission.
