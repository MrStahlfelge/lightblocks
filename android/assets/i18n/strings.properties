multiplayerLanHelp=A local multiplayer game needs no internet connection. You connect the decives by using the same \
  WLAN or Wifi Direct (available in Android's Extended WLAN settings menu). Then one player opens up a room which the other \
  players can join.\n\n\
  The player creating the room is the owner and server for the other players. If the room owner disconnects, \
  all other players are disconnected from the game.
multiplayerLanDisconnected=Room left. Open a new one or rejoin.

tutorialStep0=Welcome to Falling Lightblocks!\nTap to start tutorial.
tutorialStep1=Probably you have seen a game with similar gameplay before. Main concept is very easy...\n(Tap to continue)
tutorialStep2=One after another block is falling down your gameboard. You can rotate it and move it sideways.\n(Tap to continue)
tutorialStep3=When the block is dropped at the ground, it can't be moved any more.\n(Tap to continue)
tutorialStep4=If a line is full of blocks, they disappear and you get score. Now that's really easy, isn't it?\n(Tap to continue)
tutorialStep5=Now you want to know how you can rotate and move these blocks? It's easy, too...\n(Tap to continue)
tutorialStep6=Just tap on the right half of the screen to rotate the block clockwise. Try it!
tutorialStep7=Very good. Now tap on the left half of the screen to rotate the block counterclockwise!
tutorialStep8=Very good! You will be a champion!\nPerhaps you noticed a virtual gamepad appearing every time you tapped on the screen. \
  Tap down and hold to get a closer look! Then lift your finger and tap to continue.
tutorialStep9=You can move the block the following way: Tap the screen and hold, swipe to the arrow pointing to your desired direction and still hold! \
  The block will move until you lift your finger. Try to move it to the right boundary!
tutorialStep10=Perfect! Now move it to the left boundary!
tutorialStep11=Perhaps you noticed there is also an arrow pointing downwards for moving the active block faster to the ground.\n(Tap to continue)
tutorialStep12=Now you learned about the basics of Falling Lightblock's Gesture Control.\n\
  There is also a Gravity control available which is much more difficult.\n(Tap to continue)
tutorialStep13=You can switch off the visibility of the virtual gamepad in the settings.\nNow complete this tutorial by just clearing one line. Tap to begin - and good luck. :-)
tutorialMission01_1=Now you are in your first real mission. Missions have different goals you have to achieve. \n(Tap to continue)
tutorialMission01_2=Such a goal could be clearing a certain number of lines, or gain a certain score. \
  You will be informed about the goal at the beginning or in the pause screen. \n(Tap to continue)
tutorialMission01_3=In this first mission, you just have to be relaxed. \n And clear five lines.\nThe more score you gain, the better.\n \
  The more lines you clear at once, the more score you get! \n \
  Single line: 40\nTwo lines: 100\nThree lines: 300\nFour lines: 1200\n (Tap to continue)
tutorialMission01_4=You see, you have to clear as much lines at once as possible! \n Now, go on! Have fun!
goalRelax=To complete this mission, you have to\nclear {0} lines and\ngain a score of {1}.\nMaximum number of blocks to use: {2}
goalClean=To complete this mission, clean the initial garbage from the gameboard. You have a maximum number of {0} blocks to use.
goalSpecialMove=To complete this mission, you have to\nclean four lines at once {0} times\nmake {1} T-Spins\nachieve {3} Double Specials.\
  \nMaximum number of blocks to use: {2}
tutorialMission04_1=Perhaps you realized that game speed is increasing - you are getting better!\n \
  Now it is time again to learn a bit.\n (Tap to continue)
tutorialMission04_2=As said before: The more lines you clear at once, the more points you get. There is no way to \
  clear more than four lines at once, and there is only one block with which you can do it: the I. \
  On average, you get an I every seventh block.\n (Tap to continue)
tutorialMission04_3=That is why clearing four lines is a "special" clear in this game and gets rewarded with such a high score. \
  You should try to accomplish a "four liner" as often as possible. This is your excercise lesson now. Make a four liner! But: You've got only 30 blocks!
tutorialMission06_1=T-Spin time!\nAnother special move in this game is the so-called "T-Spin". As the name suggests, \
  it can only performed with the T block. I have prepared the gameboard for you to exercise T-Spins.\n(Tap to continue)
tutorialMission06_2=You can perform a T-Spin on this gameboard by let the T falling down at the left boundary with its \
  nose to the left. (Nice as I am, I also prepared that for you.)\n\
  When it hits the ground but is still not dropped, rotate it counterclockwards and the magic will happen.\n\
  Timing is everything. You can do it!
tutorialMission08_1=Another way to a achieve a higher score is to get score for Double Specials. How to do that? \
  Now that is easy: Clear four lines at once and then clear four lines at once a second time.\n(Tap to continue)
tutorialMission08_2=The only important thing is that you do not make a normal line clear in the meantime. \
  You will be rewarded with a double special bonus: you get 50% more score for your clear.\nTry it now!
goalGarbage=To complete this mission, you have to\nplace {0} blocks.\nBeware of the incoming garbage!
tutorialMission09_1=Lightblocks has a great multiplayer mode which you should try!\nWhen playing against an opponent, \
  you got the same blocks, and if one clears at least two lines at once the other one will get garbage inserted in his \
  gameboard.\n(Tap to continue)
tutorialMission09_2=Playing with garbage needs completely different tactics. You must try to be ready for an I to \
  perform a Four Liner, but in addition you must always be ready to clear lines for not getting too high.\n\
  Now it's time to exercise! Place 75 blocks on the board to complete this mission.\n\
  You will see, playing against garbage is a challenge! Have fun!
